# Landing Page
Landing page project - part of The Odin Project. In this project I use the provided layout to create a website for the fictional V-Tuber agency called "V-Union".

## Requirements
The requirements are to create a landing page with the same layout as the images inside of the project linked here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page

## Lessons learned
Through this project I was able to get a better understanding of how to use FlexBox to create a proper layout for my websites. I also got a solid understanding of how to structure a clean and accesible landing page.
